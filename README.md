This repo will contain code and markdown files of things that I learn as I try to understand concepts in ML and beyond. Potentially useful proof-of-work.

#### **Video/Course stuff:**

- Karpathy's series: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ (i've watched micrograd twice and I understand it extremely well now; I coded along side Andrej and I plan to make a YouTube video of me just talking about what I did (so that I myself can verbalise what I did to myself because the people around me are really smart and already know this); need to start makemore)
