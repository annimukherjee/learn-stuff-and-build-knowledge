Preparing for an intreview. Don't know what sort of questions will be asked, only that it will be around "basic python".

So here are some programmes that I'm practicing...


## Q1: Frequency Counter
Write a function that takes a list of strings and returns a dictionary with the count of each string.

## Q2: Parse Log File
Youâ€™re given lines from a simplified log file. Write a function that parses each line and returns a list of dictionaries with keys: "timestamp", "user", and "action".
